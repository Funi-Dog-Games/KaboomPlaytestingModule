# Kaboom Playtesting Module 🛠️
Frontend for [the kaboom testing utility](https://github.com/Funi-Dog-Games/KaboomPlaytestingUtility)

A demo for this module can be found in the [releases tab](https://github.com/Funi-Dog-Games/KaboomPlaytestingModule/releases)

## Why use this module?
This module is intended to track and manage the sessions of users for the discord bot. The bot is used to track how long users playtest your game by assigning them a quota they much reach, it's all automated and much better than manual playtesting, where plans change and people don't show up.
